md5anim_trim
============

A tool for reducing file size of md5anim-files that have been exported using suboptimal tools. Currently just rounds the floating point numbers to a smaller scale. 
Should later be using the hierarchy{} -structure of md5anim-files to find and remove unnecessary information from the frames.

Supports individual md5anim -files and zip archives consisting of a collection of these files.
